# My custom GTD

Inspired by the "Get things done" method, this app is a sort of improved todolist with personalized labels/tags and a powerful sorting algorithm so you know what to do at all times.

Already used for myself, this app is under construction and you can't create user from client for now.

See the app here :
https://my-custom-gtd.netlify.app

This application use graphQl and other cool technologies.

This repo is the frontend but it is a full stack app. See the backend API repo here : https://github.com/lydstyl/221016-gab-gtd-apollo-server
